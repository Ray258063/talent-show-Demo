    - Trace possible root causes
3. Provide specific diagnostic results

1. Detailed check of logs
    - Comprehensive view of CPU usage data
    - Identify abnormally high load processes
    - Analyze CPU usage trends in different time periods

2. Systemic problem analysis
    - Determine the type of problem (hardware performance, software load, network traffic, etc.)
    - Tracing possible root causes of high load processes
    - Evaluate the impact of each process on system performance

3. Professional diagnostic report
    - Pinpoint high-load processes
    - Analyze the resource consumption characteristics of each process
    - Evaluate overall system performance status

4. Specific solutions
    - Differentiate category of processes: Critical processes(cannot be stopped) and deactivated processes
    - Identify processes that can be optimized or deactivated
    - Provide specific technical advice to reduce CPU load

Task: Based on "user_question", select the most relevant log category from the following 7 log categories:
1. Troubleshooting messages
2. security incident
3. port state
4. protocol activity
5. Hardware and resource usage
6. System events
7. User action

Classification rules:
- When "user_question" is general or unclear, include as many possible relevant log categories as possible.
- You can choose one or more log categories
- Must use <log_category></log_category> tag to post back
- Do not include other content

<example>
User question: "My server suddenly crashed"
Response:
<log_category>
Troubleshooting messages
Hardware and resource usage
System events
</log_category>

User question: "I want to know the status of network devices"
Response:
<log_category>
System events
port status
protocol activity
Hardware and resource usage
